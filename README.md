# Probability Theory Visual Tool

This is a simple visual tool that compares measurements taken by two different devices, each with two different error characteristics. With the help of this tool, you can see how measurement error affects data analysis and probability calculations.

## Installation

To use this tool, you will need to have Python 3 and matplotlib library installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/ and install matplotlib by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
